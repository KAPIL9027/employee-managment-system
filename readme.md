# Instructions to run the app
  - Run "npm i" command in backend, frontend and root folder to install all the dependencies

  - Create an .env file in frontend folder with backend url
    "VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/employees"

  - Run "npm run dev" command to run both the frontend and backend

  - Create some employees using add employee functionality as database is not persistent. So It is required to see some employees data in the dashboard

  - Might need to reload the dashboard after creating new employees as it fetches data only when the component is mounted
